    <h1>Welcome to ThermoNED</h1>
    <p>an annual symposium on human thermoregulation and thermal environments </p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      ThermoNED is an informal get-together for researchers in the Netherlands and bordering countries 
      - we also have attendees from Germany, Belgium, France, UK, ... - and whoever is interested and/or involved
      in research on thermoregulation, environmental factors and health in humans and/or animals. 
      It is a forum to exchange information on recent studies, results, and protocols: and to discuss and develop
      new research plans and establish collaborations.
    </p>

    <h2>When and where? </h2>
    <p>
      Each year, we change the location of the meeting to visit each other's labs, universities
      and cities. In 2025, we were hosted at the TU Delft. 
      In 2026, we will celebrate the <b>20th edition of ThermoNED</b>. 
      The meeting will take place at Maastricht University, on the 17th of April 2026.

      <h2>Who? </h2>
    <p>
      ThermoNED has some loyal ‘regulars’, but we are very much looking forward to meeting new people 
      and to expand the group. Therefore, please feel free to suggest newcomers and to forward this information 
      to others who might be interested. Please note that thermoregulation doesn’t always need to be 
      the main focus – it is especially inspiring to discuss anything temperature-related from 
      all different kinds of perspectives.

    </p>
