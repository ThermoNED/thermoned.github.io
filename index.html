    <h1>Welcome to ThermoNED</h1>
    <p>An annual symposium on human thermoregulation and thermal environments </p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      ThermoNED is an open and informal network for researchers in the Netherlands and neighboring countries — 
      including participants from Germany, Belgium, France, the UK, and beyond — who share an interest in thermoregulation, 
      environmental physiology, and health in humans and/or animals. 
      
      The network provides a welcoming forum to exchange knowledge, share recent findings and experimental protocols, 
      and explore new research ideas and collaborations in the field of environmental and thermal physiology.
    </p>

    <h2>When and where? </h2>
    <p>
      Each year, ThermoNED is hosted by a different institution, allowing us to visit one another’s laboratories, universities, and cities across the region.
      In 2025, the meeting took place at TU Delft.
      In 2026, we will celebrate the 20th edition of ThermoNED, which will be hosted by Maastricht University on 17 April 2026.

      <h2>Who? </h2>
    <p>
      ThermoNED has some loyal ‘regulars’, but we are very much looking forward to meeting new people 
      and to expand the group. Therefore, please feel free to suggest newcomers and to forward this information 
      to others who might be interested. Please note that thermoregulation doesn’t always need to be 
      the main focus – it is especially inspiring to discuss anything temperature-related from 
      all different kinds of perspectives.
